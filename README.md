# Predicting-Real-Disaster-LSTM-GLOVE
Predicting Real Disaster LSTM &amp; GLOVE
The project aims at using machine learning and NLP to build a model that distinguishes tweets that are related to an actual disaster. The dataset contains the text of the tweet and the lebel (real disaster or not real disaster). Also, a dataset of pre-trained global vectors for word representation was provided. After some data wrangling and exploratory data analysis, Keras API with Tensorflow backend was used to train a neural network, yielding a validation accuracy of 0.77 on the balanced dataset. Additionally, insights were discovered that real disaster tweets tend to have greater average lengths and the language is more formal, it also uses words like “outbreak”, “wreckage”, and “debris” which are not used in those non-disaster tweets.
